QTs for Windows, Mac OSX and Linux (64 bit). I do not know if the Linux will work as crossing over to a new environment can distress poor Linux. But cd into its location and try:  

chmod +x BDSM-FETISH-qt

-----

Alternatively git clone it, cd into the directory and:

qmake

make

------

Deps: sudo apt-get install git build-essential libssl-dev libboost-all-dev libqrencode-dev libdb++-dev libminiupnpc-dev qt-sdk -y
